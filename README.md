# Python Project: Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis
In this project, I performed the following steps in two separate notebooks.

Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA,) Feature Selection and Engineering, Data Splitting, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Testing and Validation, Model Deployment, Data Visualization

In Part 1, I carried out the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and visualization sections, while in Part 2, I worked on the Model Development phase. Throughout these analysis processes, I provided detailed explanations. I tried to emphasize the importance of each step for data science. Through this project file, I created a cheat sheet for my future work. By using these project files, you can obtain a comprehensive source of code and theoretical knowledge regarding the data analysis and model development processes.
